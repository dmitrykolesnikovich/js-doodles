  iframe {
    background: red;
    width: 80%;

<pre>
steps:
  1. set devicePixelRatio to 1.25 or 2.5 (see below)
  2. size window

What happens:

  red lines appear

What should happens

  no red lines appear

</pre>
<iframe src="child.html"></iframe>

<p>
Generally you can modify the devicePixelRatio by setting the zoom level
to 125%. You can also set it on Windows by setting a custom scaling size</p>
<p></p>
To set DPI to 1.25 on Windows
<ol>
<li>Right Click desktop and pick "Display Settings"</li>
<li>Under "Scale and Layout" chose "Advanced scaling settings</li>
<li>Set custom scaling size to "125"</li>
</ol>
<p>
People with vision issue often set a custom scaling size or zoom.

<p>
Note: the issue is not just with vertical stuff. The same issue
can appear on the right of an iframe but the vertical issue repoed
immediately so I didn't bother making a horizontal repo.
</p>
<p>
Also note: This is not an easy issue to work around. The problem is
you can't know the background color of an iframe a priori. If you set
a background for an iframe (ie, iframe { background: &lt;some-color&gt;; }). 
You'll get these lines of <code>some-color</code> but in order to know
what to set <code>some-color</code> to make these lines blend into your
design you need to know what color the iframe itself will use which you
can't know if it's a 3rd party iframe nor even easily if you have a large
collection of content that can appear in that iframe.
</p>
<p>Of course even then, that's working around the actual bug instead
if fixing the bug. The fix is the frame should include that extra line
OR that extra line should belong to the containing page's other content, not
the iframe element.</p>
